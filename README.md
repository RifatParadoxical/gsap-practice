# GSAP Practice

This repository contains my learning and experimentation with **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**. It showcases animations, techniques, and features I explored while mastering GSAP for creative and engaging web development projects from Sheriyans Coding School.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Core GSAP Concepts**: Covers animations, tweens, and timelines.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Includes easing, ScrollTrigger, and element-specific animations.
- **Custom Animations**: Unique implementations and personalized experiments with GSAP.
- **Reusable Components**: Well-structured code for modular and scalable animations.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout adjustments.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic and animation integration.
- **GSAP**: Main animation library used in this project.
